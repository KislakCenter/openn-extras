# OPenn extras

Handy scripts demonstrating working with data on the OPenn website. So far, 
the scripts are:

- `openn-page-counts` -- pull down and rewrite an OPenn repository contents CSV
    with page counts
- `openn-page-counts-brief` -- pull down and rewriate an OPenn repository 
    contents CSV with page counts in brief format
    
See the scripts for documentation
